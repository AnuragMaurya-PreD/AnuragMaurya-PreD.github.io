<!-- # NTNU Experience

Studying abroad at NTNU in Norway was a game-changer for me. Surrounded by stunning landscapes and a rich culture, NTNU offered more than just lectures. The academic vibe, tech advancements, and top-notch labs all played a role in shaping my journey and personal growth.

**This blog is aimed to highlight some of the important lessons that I learned. Also, to motivate students to explore beyond the classes.**

In the winter of 2022–2023, I did a semester exchange at NTNU Norway through an agreement between my home institution. Amongst other universities, I chose NTNU for its culture in control theory and robotics. I was also amazed at the cutting-edge research that NTNU was doing in bringing an interdisciplinary approach to the marine sector. This decision was significant as I was the first in my family to study abroad, bringing immense pride. Witnessing the culture of 18 countries at 21 was a memorable highlight of the experience.

### Academic Experience

NTNU's academic culture is all about being innovative, working together, and thinking critically. At NTNU, students are encouraged to think outside the box, try new things, and solve problems in different ways. I got to have great discussions with both classmates and teachers, which helped me understand subjects better.

NTNU also focuses on independent learning, but teachers are always there to help. Whether I was attending lectures, joining seminars, or working on group projects, NTNU's academic environment made me curious and determined to learn more. This experience has stuck with me and made me stronger.

I took the following courses at my semester exchange:

- TDT4136 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
- TMM4150 Machine Design and Mechatronics
- TPK4170 Robotics
- TPK4460 Robotics and Automation

I feel excited to share the pics that I took of the NTNU campus, surroundings,housing and facilities:

### Laboratories

At NTNU, I had the amazing opportunity to work in their cutting-edge laboratories during my semester exchange. These labs, led by top researchers and equipped with advanced technology, were hubs of innovation and discovery. Whether I was experimenting in chemistry, physics, or engineering, I found myself fully immersed in the world of scientific exploration.

I was given access to NTNU’s Supercomputer IDUN for the RL project in a course. During the mechatronics project, I found the lab to be very organised and equipped with the latest facilities.

### Experience of living in a foreign country

My journey through Norway was a breathtaking adventure filled with stunning landscapes and vibrant city life. Starting in Bergen, I was immediately captivated by its picturesque harbor, surrounded by colorful wooden houses known as Bryggen. Exploring the narrow cobblestone streets, I soaked in the rich history and culture of this charming coastal city. A highlight was riding the Fløibanen funicular to the top of Mount Fløyen, where I was rewarded with panoramic views of Bergen and its surrounding fjords.

Next, I ventured to Oslo, Norway's dynamic capital city. Here, modern architecture seamlessly blends with historical landmarks. Visiting the iconic Oslo Opera House, I marveled at its sleek design and walked along its sloping roof for stunning views of the city and Oslofjord. Delving into Norway's heritage, I explored the Viking Ship Museum and marveled at the well-preserved Viking vessels. Strolling through Vigeland Park, I was struck by the beauty of Gustav Vigeland's intricate sculptures, which depict the human experience profoundly and movingly.
