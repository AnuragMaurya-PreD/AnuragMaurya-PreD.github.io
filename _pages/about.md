I am also diving into video recogniion and video object detection paradigm of Computer Vision. 


What this portfolio is about:
======
I see education not just as a means to personal growth but also as a force for societal transformation. Personally, I view academia as a valuable tool to expand scientific boundaries. However, I recognize it comes with a duty to inspire and guide. This portfolio is not just about showcasing my work. It's a mirror for me to introspect and maybe share a little. 

I insist on visitng my blog section. ;)
