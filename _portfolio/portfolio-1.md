A part of the Robotic Nurse Project for patient assistance, funded by TIH, IIT Delhi
* Completed work:
    * Decoupled long horizon demonstrations into Dynamic Movement Primitives.
    * Benchmarked Long-term recurrent convolutional networks and slow-fast network with CTC loss
    * Used Timesformer as spatiotemporal encoder and Transformer decoder surpassing the existing results.
* Current work:
    * End-to-end imitation learning as a follow-up to Stanfordâ€™s Mobile Aloha using just video demonstrations
    * Working on using GCN as an encoder and action chunking transformer as a decoder.
